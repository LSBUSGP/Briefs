# Old Money System

Create a monetary system for a game based in British history before decimalisation. You need to be able to represent monetary value in terms of [£sd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/£sd). You must create a class in csharp to represent amounts with functions to: add and subtract amounts; and, test if one amount is equal to, or greater, or less than another amount. You must provide a test program to demonstrate these features. You must also include the documentation needed to use your system.
