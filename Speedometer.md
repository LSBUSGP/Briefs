# Speedometer

A script is required to measure the current speed of an object through Unity world space. The script must take the speed from the standard Unity `Rigidbody` component. The result needs to be converted from the standard Unity scale of meters per second into miles per hour.

You must include the following in your Unity package:

1. the required scripts
2. a scene demonstrating the component
3. documentation for this component

## Extra credit

Include a display component which converts the speed into a rotary dial as illustrated above.
