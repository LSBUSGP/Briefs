# Edge Detection Shader

Create a post-processing effects filter to create an illustrated art look to the rendering in a game. You must create a shader that performs edge detection and highlights edges. The thickness and colour of the highlight must be shader parameters. You must provide the shader asset and any materials needed to make it work, a test program demonstrating the shader, and full documentation.

You must include the following in your Unity package:

1. required shader and assets
2. a scene demonstrating the shader with adjustable parameters
3. documentation
