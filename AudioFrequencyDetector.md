# Audio Frequency Detector

A rhythm based music game requires a script to generate level data from music tracks. You must provide a script that can detect 4 distinct frequencies from the currently playing music track. Include an example scene that shows or hides 4 boxes when the frequencies are present in the music. The frequencies to detect and the thresholds should be configurable in the Inspector.
