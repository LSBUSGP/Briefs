# Find The Area

Given a list of at least 3 2D points (`Vector2`) return the contained area. You can use the shoelace algorithm to solve this problem or come up with your own. The algorithm should be O(n) in time, that is a shape of 9 points should take no more than 3 times as long as a shape of 3 points.

You must include the following in your Unity package:

1. the required scripts
2. a scene demonstrating the component
3. documentation for this component

Throw an exception or return 0 area if less than 3 points are passed.
