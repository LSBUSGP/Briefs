# Rolling Road

A system is required for building an infinite road in an endless runner style of game. As the current end of the road is about to enter the camera's viewport, the system should spawn in a new section of road. Sections behind the camera's viewport should be removed. The camera should remain stationary and the road should move towards it to give the appearance of motion. The speeds and distances should customisable through the inspector.

You must include the following in your Unity package:

1. the required scripts
2. any required prefabs
3. a scene to demonstrate the system
4. documentation for this component

## Extra Credit

For extra credit on this brief, allow the generated road to choose from a random set of prefab sections and travel in different directions.
