# Image Compositing Shader

A game requires the ability to place the player's live image into the game's world. The game requires that the player sits in front of a green or blue screen so that their image can be composited into the game's graphics. A shader is required to compose the player's portrait with a game supplied background image. The game must be able to customise the colour and tolerance of the colour key removal. The shader must work with any supplied image source but should demonstrate the functionality by using the live feed from an attached web cam.

You must include the following in your Unity package:
